#Is it dry?
##The ever-important question. You can't send on sodden stone!


#But how do you know if it'll actually be dry?
##Good question. There are a few things I'm hoping to take into account:
  - Humidity
  - Most recent precipitation
  - Wind
  - Cloud cover
  - Temperature


##Maybe I'll actually pull this off!
